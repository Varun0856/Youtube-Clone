# YouTube Clone 🎥

This is a **YouTube Clone** built as a part of my journey in **Frontend Development**. The project focuses on replicating the **UI/UX** of YouTube, without any backend or video functionality. It’s designed to give users a similar experience to browsing YouTube but is currently static.

## Features ✨

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Navigation Bar**: Includes a YouTube-like header with a logo, search bar, and user profile icons.
- **Video Thumbnails**: Displays video thumbnails with titles and descriptions in a grid layout.
- **Search Bar UI**: A search bar where users can input queries (currently not functional).

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
